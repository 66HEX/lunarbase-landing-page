# LunarBase

A security-first database management platform that combines the power of Rust's performance with React's flexibility. LunarBase delivers reliable data management through an intuitive admin interface built entirely with the proprietary **Nocta UI** component library.

## Why LunarBase?

LunarBase is a comprehensive platform designed for organizations that prioritize security while requiring modern, real-time capabilities. Built with a security-first mindset, every component has been designed to protect your data while providing the flexibility and performance modern applications require.

## Security at the Core

Security isn't an afterthought in LunarBase—it's the foundation. Our multi-layered security architecture ensures your data remains protected at every level:

### Advanced Authentication & Authorization

- **Secure password hashing** with Argon2id (65536 memory, 4 iterations, 2 parallelism)
- **Password pepper protection** with server-side secret salt to defend against rainbow table attacks
- **Dual-token JWT system** with short-lived access tokens (15 min) and secure refresh tokens (7 days)
- **HttpOnly cookies** with secure, SameSite=Lax configuration and path restrictions
- **Comprehensive token blacklisting** for immediate session revocation
- **Intelligent brute force protection** with account lockout after 5 failed attempts
- **Rate limiting** (1000 requests per 5 minutes per IP) to prevent abuse
- **Timing attack protection** with consistent response delays

### Granular Permission System

- **Multi-level access control** spanning collections, records, and individual fields
- **Role-based hierarchy** with user/admin distinction and custom permission overrides
- **Ownership-based permissions** with automatic owner privilege assignment
- **Real-time permission validation** for WebSocket connections and live data
- **Admin self-protection** mechanisms to prevent accidental privilege removal

### Data Protection & Integrity

- **Database encryption at rest** with SQLCipher providing transparent AES-256 encryption
- **SQL injection prevention** through parameterized queries and comprehensive input validation
- **CSRF protection** via SameSite cookie policies
- **XSS prevention** through httpOnly cookie storage and input sanitization
- **Schema validation** to prevent malicious data structure modifications
- **Audit trails** for all operations with comprehensive logging
